/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for RunAndDeploy application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only read and write their own profile data and uploaded links.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/uploadedLinks/{uploadId}: Stores uploaded links associated with a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create their own user document (self-registration).
 * - Users can only manage their own uploaded links.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Data validation is relaxed for rapid prototyping but MUST be tightened in production.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `UploadedLink` documents MUST contain a `userId` field that matches the `userId` in the path.
 *  - This is enforced during creation and update to maintain relational integrity.
